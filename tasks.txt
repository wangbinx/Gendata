Phase 1:
1.	Bug is included in Pcd.dsc. Pcd.dsc can be generated by ConvertFceToPcd.py -m pcd.map -c Config.txt -l Advanced.lst -l EmulationDfxSetupForms.lst -l FpgaSktSetupForms.lst -l SocketSetupForms.lst -l Tcg2Config.lst -o pcd.dsc
a.	0xffffffff doesn’t require L
b.	FieldName memFlows is wrong
2.	Find Guid value and Guid CName map in Guid.xref, then replace guid value with guid CName
3.	gStructPcdTokenSpaceGuid.PcdSetupData|L"Setup"|ec87d643-eba4-4bb5-a1e5-3f3e36b20da9|0x00 is placed together, and only placed in the first section
4.	Output file will include [SkuIds], [DefaultStores], and [PcdsDynamicHii] all. 
5.	There is no Pcd.map. its information will be got from the config file and lst files.
a.	DEFAULT ID: 0 ? STANDARD, 1 ? MANUFACTURING, 2 or more ? DEFAULTID2 or DEFAULTIDX
b.	PLATFORM ID: 0 ? DEFAULT, 1 ? SKUID1, 2->SKUID2 …
c.	Every variable will map to one PCD. PCD name is gStructPcdTokenSpaceGuid.PcdVariableName. Its structure name is from efivarstore in lst file. Its variable attribute and guid is from config file. If attribute is 7, it will be converted to NV, BS, RT. If attribute is 3, it will be converted to NV, BS. Below is style. Its guid value will be converted to GuidCName based on input Guid.xref.

gStructPcdTokenSpaceGuid.PcdSetupData|L"Setup"|ec87d643-eba4-4bb5-a1e5-3f3e36b20da9|0x00||NV, BS, RT

Phase 2:
1.	Collect all .lst file from Build output directory. Its parent directory is DEBUG. And, collect its OUTPUT *.inf file. If *.inf doesn’t exist, those lst files can be ignored. 
2.	Generate another style gStructPcdTokenSpaceGuid.PcdVariableName
  gStructPcdTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPchSetup|{0}|PCH_SETUP|0x00000005{  # {0} is hard code, PcdVariableName and its structure name has been got. The latest one is the number from 0xFCD00000
    <HeaderFiles>
      PchSetupVariable.h  # header file is from lst, find the first line of structure name, then find next first line of “#line” as the begin, then get its header file in this line end.  
    <Packages>
      ServerPlatformPkg/PlatformPkg.dec # package lists are from [Packages] section of lst file mapped INF file.
